To our best knowledge, a succinct set of words to define a dictionary where words are presented alongside their translations and one where words from a single language are presented with their definitions with groupings for synyoynms and hypernyms are not available.
Thus, we will refer the first type as a bilingual dictionary and the second type as a monolingual dictionary.
James Somers puts down the currently available modern dictionaries by saying \enquote{The definitions are these desiccated little husks of technocratic meaningese, as if a word were no more than its coordinates in semantic space.} which is a bother for a writer but gives us further encouragement with our intuition.
