% Dictionaries take time and effort to make you can cite life of Webster or ask about Turkish lexiconners?
Dictionaries are the catalog of a languages wordstock.
Listing the available tools together is invaluable for the user.
For language, tools are senses that come together.
Dictionary acts as an instructions manual and just like the real ones, people do not think they really need one until the time comes.
Having a guide book at hand proves useful.

proves to show how important they really are.
What about dictionaries for machines?

WordNet is a lexical database.
It includes groupings of senses and calls them synsets.
Every synset
% what is a lemma
% what is a synset
% hypernym ... several others I forgot.

Further research in the area contributes to more languages having access to tools that will incorporate them into the literature.
English in not the centerpiece for most natural language processing research because it is the language that can store the most information or any other linguistic property.
It's the most abundant language on web.
% TODO hubness problem
Distributions like spaCy resorts to lemmatizations like =PRON= to denote pronouns in order to collapse the senses for "I", "you", "them" etc\@.
The sense and the accompanying word for being the brother of someone's father or mother differs in Turkish\footnote{\emph{Amca} for brother of the father and \emph{DayÄ±} for brother of the father.}.
Yet no distinction exists for English and senses collapse together in \emph{uncle}.
This thesis is working on this subject.

% Resnik & Yarrowsky (1999) has my most basic hypothesis

To our best knowledge, a succinct set of words to define a dictionary where words are presented alongside their translations and one where words from a single language are presented with their definitions with groupings for synyoynms and hypernyms are not available.
Thus, we will refer the first type as a bilingual dictionary and the second type as a monolingual dictionary.
James Somers puts down the currently available modern dictionaries by saying \enquote{The definitions are these desiccated little husks of technocratic meaningese, as if a word were no more than its coordinates in semantic space.}\cite{noauthor_youre_nodate}

The lack of WordNets for languages other than English has been tackled before %TODO reference

Coupled with the licensing issue which prevents scientific research from using some WordNets.
This study is constrained only to freely available WordNets.
Open Multilingual WordNet~\cite{bond_survey_2012} presents wordnets from other languages with three crucial additions; % TODO the following sentence is plagiarism
the data is normalized, aligned with English Princeton WordNet and they are all accessible from a single source~\footnote{\url{http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/}}.
With alignment information at hand, we have a way to create a golden corpora that we assume to be perfectly aligned.
Among the %TODO how many
wordnets available on Open Multilingual WordNet, only %TODO
has definition or gloss information built in.
Given this thesis will only investigate the ability to map senses using definitinos of the sense, we used the subset of Albanian~\cite{ruci_current_2008}, Bulgarian~\cite{simov_constructing_2010}, Greek~\cite{stamou_exploring_2004}, Italian~\cite{pianta_multiwordnet_2002}, Slovenian~\cite{fiser_slownet_2012} and Romanian~\cite{tufis_romanian_2008}.
