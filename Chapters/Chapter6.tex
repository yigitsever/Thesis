\chapter{Experiments and Evaluation}%
\label{chap:experiments_and_evaluation}

We experimented with in domain \emph{fasttext} embeddings.
We have trained Romanian and Bulgarian embeddings and ran the WMD and Sinkhorn experiments.
The performance dropped to the quarter of pre-trained embeddings so we have not repeated the experiments for other language corpora.
